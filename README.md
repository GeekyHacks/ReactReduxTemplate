This repo includes a react basic layout using Vite. It includes Redux, eslint, and stylelint linter tests.

## Steps to use this Template effectively

- clone the template to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/GeekyHacks/ReactReduxTemplate.git .`
- Make sure you are in the root project directory inside `react-reduxtemplate` folder
- Change the name in line `"name": "react-reduxtemplate"` in `package.json`
- run the following command `npm install` to download the node_modules folder, which include all the packages included in the `package.json` file
- run `npm run dev` to see if the react app is working or not
- run `npx eslint "**/*.{js,jsx}"` to test eslint package, it should work smoothly
- run `npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"` to test stylelint package.
- You are all set. Now you can use this Template for any react project.
- You can edit the `READMETEMPLATE.md` to suit your project

## Important notes about react projects

- always add directories into src folder
